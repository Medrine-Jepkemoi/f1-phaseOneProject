# PHASE ONE FINAL PROJECT

#### About

This is a one page website that will allow Formula One fans to know more about their favourite drivers, rate and review them

## Description

This is a one page webapp about formula one drivers and their details. This project tests my understanding of vanilla javascript mainly on DOM manipulation, javascript events and communicating with the server, html and css. Once a user accesses the site, they will be able to:

1. Click on the items on the navbar to be redirected to the various sections of the page
2. On the drivers section, a user will be able to like a driver and hover on the drivers card to view more details about them
3. A user can be able to filter the drivers based on their nationalities
4. They should be able to leave a written review about drivers which will be seen on the screen once thw submit button has been clicked

## Setup/Installation Requirements

To access my site:

1. Clone the repository into a desired folder.
2. Open the now local repository to access the code
3. Open / run the live server to be able to use the site. Once on the site, interact with it by clicking on the list to view a description of the data. Click on the buy ticket button to purchase a ticket.
